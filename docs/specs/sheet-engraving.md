# Sheet Music Engraving Specification (MuseScore Parity)

## Overview
Easy Piano renders piano sheet music on Flutter canvas using SMuFL (Standard Music Font Layout) compliant vector fonts (Leland as primary, Bravura as fallback).
The engraving engine is designed for full algorithmic parity with **MuseScore Studio** (`references/MuseScore/src/engraving/rendering/score/`) and follows standard professional engraving principles established by Elaine Gould (*Behind Bars*).

## Layout & Architecture Principles
1. **Audio Clock is Master:** The score scrolls or advances based on real-time audio time (beats), never on frame deltas.
2. **Modular Components:** Staves rendering is decomposed into specialized, unit-tested layout modules under `app/lib/ui/staff/`:
   - `smufl.dart`: SMuFL glyph code points, digit glyphs, tuplet numbers.
   - `stem_layout.dart`: Gould middle-line stem direction, chord voting, ledger elongation.
   - `beam_layout.dart`: Metric subdivision, half-measure 4/4 grouping, slope clamping, parallel secondary beams.
   - `chord_layout.dart`: Second interval displacement (preventing notehead collisions).
   - `key_signature.dart`: Sharps and flats vertical positions, system spacing, accidental spelling.
   - `tuplet_layout.dart`: Triplet grouping, SMuFL tuplet digits, unbeamed bracket rendering.
   - `engraving_decorations.dart`: Tapering quadratic Bézier ties and articulation placement.
   - `staff_painter.dart`: Main custom painter coordinating the modules.
3. **No Monolithic Painters:** Every geometric calculation is isolated in its own module with mirrored unit tests under `app/test/ui/staff/`.

## Module Specifications

### 1. Dynamics and Hairpins (`dynamics_layout.dart`, `staff_painter.dart`)
- **Reference:** MuseScore `rendering/score/dynamicslayout.cpp` (centring, barline avoidance), `rendering/score/tlayout.cpp:layoutHairpinSegment` (hairpin arms), `rendering/score/systemlayout.cpp` (`centerElementsBetweenStaves`, `centerItemGroup`, `groupItemsToCenterTogether`, `elementShouldBeCenteredBetweenStaves`), `autoplace` for the clearances.
- **Style values** (`data/styles/legacy-style-defaults-v450.mss`): `dynamicsPosBelow` y=2 sp; `hairpinPosBelow` y=1.75 sp; `hairpinHeight` 1.15 sp; `hairpinLineWidth` 0.12 sp; `dynamicsMinDistance` 0.5 sp; `hairpinMinDistance` 0.7 sp; `autoplaceHairpinDynamicsDistance` 0.5 sp; `centerOnNotehead` 1; `dynamicsHairpinsAutoCenterOnGrandStaff` 1.
- **Glyph metrics** (`fonts/bravura/bravura_metadata.json`): thin barline 0.16 sp; stem 0.12 sp; black notehead 1.18 x 1.0 sp; whole notehead 1.688 sp wide.
- **Glyphs:** composed letter by letter as MuseScore `Dynamic::DYN_LIST`: `p` U+E520, `m` U+E521, `f` U+E522, `s` U+E524, `z` U+E525. Supported marks: `p pp ppp mp mf f ff fff fp sf sfz`.
- **Horizontal:** a dynamic is centred on the notehead (`centerOnNotehead`, centre = left + 0.59 sp, or 0.844 sp for whole notes). A hairpin runs from its start note's left edge to its end note's left edge. Dynamics keep 0.25 sp from the nearest barline on each side (`manageBarlineCollisions`), using the thin barline width.
- **Treble staff in a grand staff:** dynamics and hairpins of the right hand (`StaffDynamic.leftHand` false) are centred between the two staves (`centerItemGroup`): the free band runs from the bottom of the obstacles above to the top of those below, minus `minDistance` on each side. Obstacles are the staff lines and the noteheads and stems of both staves.
- **Overlapping items in that gap** form one group. They are stacked by preferred top and centred as one unit (`groupItemsToCenterTogether`, `convergence`).
- **Bass staff, or a single staff:** placed below the bottom staff line. Dynamic top at 2 sp, hairpin centre at 1.75 sp. Each is then moved down past noteheads and stems it overlaps, keeping `minDistance` (`autoplace`). Dynamics and hairpins keep 0.5 sp from each other.
- **Hairpins:** two straight arms from a tip, `hairpinHeight` 1.15 sp at the wide end, line width 0.12 sp. Crescendo tip on the left; diminuendo tip on the right. Shorter than 1 sp is stretched to 1 sp.
- **Not implemented (by design or not yet):**
  - Multi-system hairpin segments (the app paints one scrolling line, no systems).
  - Circled tip and hairpin text (`hairpinCircledTip` and `hairpinText` are off by default in MuseScore).
  - Shape-based skylines: obstacles are boxes around noteheads and stems, not the glyph outlines, and beams are not included.
  - Rests are not obstacles.
- **Known limitations (verified, not fixed):**
  - *Dense gaps:* when many marks fall in one 2-beat window of a grand staff, the stacked group can be taller than the gap and reach over a staff line. MuseScore has the same constraint, but I have not compared the exact result.
  - *Box width:* a dynamic's box is its TextPainter width, which depends on the loaded font. A wide advance can push a nearby hairpin down a little more than the real glyph would.
  - *Test fonts:* widget tests without the music font paint placeholder boxes with different metrics. Paint tests therefore check that ink exists in a region, not that a region is empty. The layout rules themselves are unit-tested without fonts.
  - *No pixel comparison* with MuseScore output has been done.
  - *Result screen:* the dynamics grade is in ResultView but not shown in the UI (piano-rdr4).- **Data:** song JSON directives, see [content-format.md](content-format.md#directives-dynamics-and-hairpins).

### 2. Piano Damper Pedal (`pedal_layout.dart`)
- **Reference:** MuseScore `pedal.cpp` and `tlayout.cpp:layoutPedal`.
- **Traditional:** $\mathfrak{Ped.}$ (U+E650) on down-stroke, $\ast$ (U+E655) on release.
- **Modern Bracket:** Continuous line with inverted notch on pedal changes (`___/\___|`), stroke width `space * 0.12`.

### 3. Arpeggios and Glissandi (`arpeggio_layout.dart`)
- **Reference:** MuseScore `arpeggiolayout.cpp`.
- **Arpeggio:** Repeated vertical wave glyph (`wiggleArpeggiato`, U+E634) connecting the bottom and top note of the chord, placed `space * 0.8` to the left of the chord.
- **Glissando:** Diagonal stroke or wave connecting two notes with centered italic label *gliss.*

### 4. Grace Notes & Ornaments (`ornament_layout.dart`)
- **Reference:** MuseScore `tlayout.cpp` and `chordlayout.cpp`.
- **Acciaccatura:** Scaled notehead ($60\%$) with upward stem sliced by a diagonal slash (U+E560).
- **Trills & Turns:** Standard SMuFL glyphs (`ornamentTrill`, `ornamentTurn`, `ornamentMordent`) centered above the notehead.

### 5. Repeats, Voltas & System Breaks (`repeat_layout.dart`)
- **Reference:** MuseScore `measurelayout.cpp` and `barline.cpp`.
- **Repeat Barlines:** Thick-thin dual line with dots in staff spaces 2 and 3.
- **Volta Brackets:** Horizontal line above measure with open/closed right edge and number label ("1.", "2.").
- **Navigation:** Segno, Coda, D.C. al Fine, D.S. al Coda.
