# Decisions

Each decision records **Context, Decision, Why, Alternatives, Impact**, plus **Status** (`proposed`, `accepted`, `superseded`, `rejected`) and **Decided by** once decided. Only the user accepts or rejects. Accepted decisions are frozen; a change is a new decision that supersedes the old one.

## Accepted

### D1. Flutter for UI on all targets

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Need Android, iOS, web (and desktop) from one codebase with 60 fps scrolling notation.
- **Decision:** Flutter (Impeller on mobile, CanvasKit/skwasm on web). Practice studio drawn with `CustomPainter`; app shell with widgets.
- **Why:** Own renderer = identical pixels on every target; mature `CustomPainter`/`Ticker`; good wasm web build; one language for UI.
- **Alternatives:** React Native + Skia (bridge jank risk, weaker web canvas story); Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose (web canvas still young); web-only PWA in TS (no reliable iOS MIDI, background audio limits); LibGDX like Simply Piano (Java, weak web/iOS today); Godot (heavy, poor app-shell UX).
- **Impact:** Contributors need Dart. Revisit if Flutter web audio/MIDI interop proves unworkable in the Phase 0 spike.

### D2. Rust core for music logic and audio

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Grading and timing must be deterministic, testable and shared; audio must avoid GC pauses.
- **Decision:** Rust crates `core` (pure logic) and `audio` (I/O, synth, pitch), bound to Dart via `flutter_rust_bridge` (FFI native, wasm web).
- **Why:** One implementation of notation parsing, grading and clock for every target; real-time safe; strong test tooling.
- **Alternatives:** All Dart (simplest; GC risk in audio path, but fine for pure logic: fallback if FRB web is painful); C++/JUCE (licensing, harder contributor onboarding).
- **Impact:** Two toolchains in CI. Phase 0 spike must prove FRB on web + Android + iOS. If it fails, keep `core` logic in Dart and only audio native.

### D3. Own JSON + text-notation content format

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Lessons must be hand-authorable, diffable in PRs, and validated.
- **Decision:** JSON files for structure (course, journey, level, stage, scene) with a compact note text notation (inspired by Simply Piano's `C4:1/4%1` style, own grammar). MusicXML and MIDI supported only as **import** sources via CLI.
- **Why:** MusicXML is verbose and painful to review; text notation is one line per phrase and carries fingering and hand.
- **Alternatives:** MusicXML as source of truth (verbose, layout noise); MIDI (no fingering/notation semantics); ABC notation (close, but weak two-hand and fingering support; reconsider as an extension).
- **Impact:** Need a parser + JSON Schema + linter. Spec: [content-format](specs/content-format.md).

### D4. No video: animation scenes instead

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Simply Piano uses ~377 CDN videos. Videos are heavy, unlocalizable, uneditable, copyrighted.
- **Decision:** Every teaching moment is an `animation` stage: a declarative timeline (keyboard highlights, hand/finger model, staff, captions, voice-over optional, synth audio) rendered by the app.
- **Why:** KB-sized, localizable via string tables, tempo-scalable, mirror-able for left-handed, fully open, editable in PR.
- **Alternatives:** Re-record our own videos (cost, same downsides); Lottie files (designer-made, not data-aware, hard to sync to notes); Rive (good for character/mascot moments: allowed inside scenes as optional asset).
- **Impact:** Need scene DSL, scene player, hand model. Reference videos are understood via `agy` (Google Antigravity CLI) to produce scene briefs. Spec: [animations](specs/animations.md).

### D5. MIDI first, microphone second

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Polyphonic mic recognition needed an ML model and echo cancellation in Simply Piano.
- **Decision:** v1 ships MIDI + on-screen touch keyboard. Mic monophonic (YIN) in Phase 3; score-informed polyphonic detection is a research track.
- **Why:** MIDI is exact and cheap; lets us validate the curriculum early.
- **Alternatives:** Mic first (most users have acoustic or no-MIDI keyboards; but high risk to block everything on ML).
- **Impact:** Early audience skews to MIDI keyboard owners. Timing windows differ per input ([exercise engine](specs/exercise-engine.md)).

### D6. Clean-room content

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** We reverse-engineer Simply Piano for structure and pedagogy. Its levels, songs, audio, art and videos are copyrighted.
- **Decision:** Never commit files, text, melodies-as-arranged, images or audio from the reference APK or its CDN. Use it only to learn structure, sequencing and mechanics. All content is original or public domain, arranged by us, licensed CC-BY-SA-4.0. `references/` is git-ignored.
- **Why:** Legal safety; open license must be clean.
- **Alternatives:** Import their content (illegal); ignore the reference (lose proven pedagogy).
- **Impact:** Agents must follow `.agents/rules/content-and-licensing.md`. Public-domain song choice is ours (Ode to Joy, Jingle Bells, Twinkle Twinkle, Minuet in G, etc.).

### D7. beans for task tracking

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Need agent-friendly tasks that live with the code, as in the vantage project.
- **Decision:** [hmans/beans](https://github.com/hmans/beans), config `.beans.yml`, prefix `piano-`, files in `.beans/`.
- **Why:** Markdown in git, CLI for agents, dependencies and epics, worked well in vantage.
- **Alternatives:** GitHub Issues (not offline, not in PR diff); TODO.md (no structure).
- **Impact:** Every PR closes its bean(s). Rules in `AGENTS.md`.

### D8. Local-first, no account required

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** Open-source app; privacy; offline practice.
- **Decision:** Progress stored locally in SQLite via `drift`: native SQLite on mobile/desktop, sqlite3 wasm on web (OPFS, IndexedDB fallback). Request `navigator.storage.persist()`; offer progress export/import file. Accounts/sync optional, later.
- **Why:** No backend cost, no personal data, works offline.
- **Alternatives:** Supabase/Firebase from day one (cost, privacy, lock-in).
- **Impact:** Sync design deferred ([OQ5](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md)).

### D9. Web is the first release target

- **Status:** accepted 2026-10-15
- **Decided by:** Yuri Olive
- **Context:** User wants the first version to run in the browser: zero install, easiest to share and test.
- **Decision:** Phase 1 ships web only (Chrome/Edge/Firefox with Web MIDI; Safari via touch, mic later). Mobile builds compile in CI but release in Phase 2. Same Flutter codebase (D1).
- **Why:** Fastest feedback loop; no store review; Web MIDI is exact on desktop browsers where most MIDI-keyboard learners sit.
- **Alternatives:** Mobile first (stores, native latency; slower iteration). TS web app + Capacitor (smaller first load, but weaker mobile MIDI/latency later; would supersede D1).
- **Impact:** Phase 0 spike must measure Flutter web first-load size and Web MIDI latency. If first load > 5 MB or latency > 30 ms p95, revisit D1. Hosting needs COOP/COEP headers.
